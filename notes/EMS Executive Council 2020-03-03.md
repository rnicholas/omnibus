## Announcements

### Conference Room

Provost study indicates conference room utilization at 24%. Going forward,
all conference rooms need to be on the scheduler. Announced in ALC. Not open
for discussion.

Sue: Flexibility and availability (on demand) important). ESM overtaking
lobby areas for group tutoring sessions while downstairs classrooms in EES.

Frank: Will consult if rooms need to redesignated as labs or work rooms.

Annie: Lots of ad hoc use of spaces in Dutton.

Me: Postdocs and staff in multi-person offices need space for one-on-one
meetings and Zoom conferences


### Cornonavirus

- Lot of activity, many subcommittees. 
- "Social distancing"
- Considering "fan free" March Madness.
- Education abroad programs in Italy cancelled.
- CDC recommending cancellation of all study abroad progams in impacted
  countries.
- Rob Crane coordinating as interim head of global programs, retiring
  shortly.
- Asking faculty to make preparations for completing classes remotely,
  provide options for participation via Zoom for impacted students.

Annie: Contingency planning for continuing classes under various disruptive
circumstances (e.g. weather delays/closures, pandemic, etc.). To be unveiled
later this week. University Strategic Messaging involved.

Kathy Bishke: Faculty searches involving visits of individuals flying in
from/through the five affected countries (China, South Korea, Iran, Italy,
Venezeula).

Laura W: Messaging and information on how to self-quarantine and be
supported in this.

John Hellman: Is self-quarantine vacation, sick leave, etc?
John Barlett: No guidance on this yet. Telecommuniting agreements are
available for employees with compromised immune systems.

John Barlett: If you have anyone coming this calendar from impacted
countries, especially China, and they don't have a visa already, they almost
certainly won't be able to get one (huge backlog as everyone now files for
expedited status).


## Strategic Planning Updates

All slides will be on EC Box share.


### Stewarding Our Planets Resources

Sarma Pisupati presenting; Alan Taylor chair

#### Climate-Energy Transition

Cross-Unit Themes
- Climate science, climate change, climate impacts
- Sustainable materials and lifecycle assessment (attracting lots of
  students)
- Sustainable energy systems (including improving extraction efficiency,
  e.g. net-zero oil production with CO2 injection)
- Energy-Water-Food Nexus (resilience, global water)
- Data analytics
- Enhancing Diversity (through graduate and postdoctoral recruiting)
- lots of additional, uncategorized ideas

Discussions/Questions
- Assess where we are and where we want to go to become a world leader in the
  Climate Energy Transition
- Should we identify specition actions we would take and establish
  meaureable outcomes?
- Does the charge to the commitee include identification of resources to get
  there?

Ideas: Utilization of coal tailings -- hundreds of millions of tons mined
and waiting in PA

Lee: There will be some funding made available for strategic initiatives
(smaller scale than Provost).


### Driving Digital Innovation

led and presented by Stevie Rocco


### Transforming Education

led and presented by Annie Taylor

Items for EESI:
- Advance Frontiers of Knowledge: integrated assessment modeling
- Foster a Curriculum... -- teach a science communications class
  built around the EarthTalks series
- Support and Empower our OUtstanding Faculty and Staff -- continue EESI
  environmental scholars to a attract diverse students, increase diversity,
  and engage students
- Prepare out Sutdents for Success in Their Careers and Lives -- Recognizing
  that we bridge from core science to applied science, and developing a
  vision for earth science [...blah...]
- Partner More Effectively with Pre-College Educators -- seek new funding
  sources through proposals to generate integrated broader-impacts efforts


### Enhancing Health

Broad, spans traditional medicine to broad ideas of wellbeing.

"Rules of Life" -- ???

EMS is only college that physical science, social science, and engineering.

"Stanford Design Concepts"

### Adviancing Arts and Humanities

Eric Schienke presenting

Does not include Museum-related activities; Jane Cook working on this
separately.

	
### Laura Weiss (VPR) comments

Suggests reaching out to College of Medicine, Huck, SSRI -- disease
connected to climate/weather, coal, minerals.

Yes, think big, go bold.

Comments on Arts & Humanities are mostly about how A&H can help EMS. How can
EMS help A&H?


### Lee: What's Next

Groups mostly done, may be asked to put together brief report based on what
was presented today.

Sue: Should Institute plans have specific action items / KPIs? There seems
to be a disconnect between these (constrained by limited funds) and a truly
aspirational plan.

Lee: Yes, use KPIs / action in Institute and Department plans.
