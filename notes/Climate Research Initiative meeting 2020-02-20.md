## Questions

0. What have been the historic barriers to Penn State having a coherent / coordinated program of "climate research"? (It appears that this has been a problem for at least 20 years.)

1. What is the intended scope of research under the initiative?
   - climate science research (i.e. research about the climate system)?
   - climate impacts?
   - climate change adaptation and risk/decision analysis?
   - carbon mitigation technology?
   - climate change adaptation technology?
   - climate policy / advocacy / communication?
   - anything and everything that can somehow be connected to climate?
   
2. What's the funding source? How does this relate to / impact existing funding streams related to climate research?

3. What are the mechanisms for interdisciplinary cohort building? What forms the connective tissue?

4. How will the initiative be governed? What's the balance between autonomy and coherent strategic direction? How does this relate to existing climate centers/initiatives?

5. How do we reconcile this initiative with Penn State's ongoing entanglement with the fossil fuel economy?


## What's this about?

Planning meeting for bigger event. Lots going on in "climate space" but not coordinated much.

- What is the structure?
- What are anticipated outcomes?
- How much of a time commitment?
- Who will be invited/involved?
- What are the strengths?
- What's missing (gap analysis)?



### Potential Goals
- greater coordination within
- more cohesive visibility without
- immediate needs

Paul: Singular focus should be on climate action, carbon neutral/negative -- redirect Penn States's faculty, staff, and $6.5B budget toward this goal

Tom suggests "Climate Discovery Day" -- sharing what we have with potential stakeholders


Title of Outreach Strategic Plan "Resilient Pennsylvania"
