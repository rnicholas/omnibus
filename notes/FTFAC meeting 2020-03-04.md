4. anything else


## Update on Sabbatical Leave for Fixed-Term Teaching Faculty

Jonathan Matthews: EMS Senate delegation is taking this up and will present
it to the Senate

Basically out of our hands at this point; may need to provide some
additional clarification

David Babb: Would be good to get someone from EMS delegation on Faculty
Affairs -- talk to caucus chair that we get this as a committee assignments;
ideally a fixed-term faculty member (Jonathan Matthews is currently on this
committee)


## Wilson Awards and Fixed-Term Faculty

Lee agrees that we don't want to further divide fixed-term and tenure-line
faculty. Our recommendations:
- encourage nomination of FT faculty for applicable awards
- for next year, we'll recommend something new that would tend to hit FT
  faculty, e.g. outstanding service to college and university


## Annual Activity Reports: Modifications to Consider?

Haven't heard any grousing yet this year, but many folks haven't started.
Still some confusion about "sustainability" question.

Are FT faculty going to be handled in Activity Insight?


## Additional Topics?

Next meeting: April 8 @ 10:30 am
