## Agenda
1. Announcements
2. Climate Crossover Discussion


## Announcements

### Report from Council of Academic Deans (Lee Kump)
- life sciences: discussion of coronavirus, most cases in 25-75 yo range,
smokers and those with respiratory disease; spreads through contact and
large droplets, not aerosolized; masks most important for those have
disease, not so helpful for those without; expect peak in next few months at
double current; to become part of background seasonal
- Damon Sims: three student deaths over weekend: Harrisburg shooting, drug OD in
residence hall, hanging in frat
- Eric Barron: budget, 0% increase for Penn State; Jake Corman advocates for
increase; expects 1.5-2% increase, would cover 5-8% of what we need; Ohio
State privatizing parking, immediately raised $200m

### Report on Undergraduate Education (Yvette Richardson)
- applications a bit down relative to last year, but admits up 6%, accepts up
  30%
- another round of EMSAGE applications just came in, new round of laurates
expected; would like to move toward awarding by department, with department
representative to "shake their hand"; tentatively March 18, early evening
- big undergrad policy changes coming in summer
  - grade forgiveness (substitute new better grade for old grade on same
    course in GPA, but still on transcript); up to 12 credits
  - max number of times to take a course 2x before petition to 3rd time
(currently 3x, petition for 4th)
- focus groups around Starfish on student success (one yesterday with deans)


## Climate Crossover / Awaken State Discussion

speakers:

- Mark Sentesy (?? professor of Philosophy), co-creator of climate ethics course
- Jim Eisenstein (emeritus professor of Political Science)
- three undergrads:
    - Allie Temple -- environmental engineering (?)
    - Gabriel Schafer (SI TRIP intern) -- energy engineering (?)
    - Josh Adams -- philosophy (?)

Sentesy points to focus on sustainability and recognition of climate change in PSU
and EMS strategic plans

Awaken State survey to 1584 undergrads, run in classes by professor
permission

- 16 questions on knowledge, feelings, and engagement related to climate
- 73% see climat change as a threat
- 65% feel powerless
- most feel they aren't being well prepared by PSU
- EMS odd outlier where 25% think climate change is not happening
    - only 19 EMS majors in survey , mostly not in EMS classes
    - how significant are these results?

recommend running survey more broadly within EMS to get clearer results

informal sense (from one undergrad) that faculty are backing away from
giving information on cliamte change

What does it mean for undergraduates to "feel prepared by Penn State to
understand/deal with climate change"?  Not defined.  Sentesy notes that it
does't seem to improve over the four years.

primary sources for information on climate change

- social media 48%
- news org 17%
- university courses/faculty 11%
- friends/family -- negative correlation with belief in climate change

Climate Crossover -- encourage faculty to teach one or two sessions on
climate change if they're not doing so already; 1800 students currently
involved in these Climate Crossover classes; EMS invited to participate;
happens during Earth Week

University Libraries has really good resource guide on media reliability and
fake news (see Linda Musser in EMS Library).

additional questions:

- How does EMS come together on these issues?
- What are careers that EMS students will be leaders in over next 30-50 years
  post graduation (e.g. lifetime of the Paris Agreement)

Should we do a series of dialogues around climate change among faculty?
e.g. Bring together petroleum engineers with climate scientists, how can we
integrate into curriculum?

May be issues whereby instructors are wary of SRTE blowback when teaching
climate change -- Brian King has experienced this directly.

follow-up discusson after speakers leave...

- Do we want to administer (a version of) the survey this semester?
- How would we want to change it? (e.g. eliminate preparedness question)
- How comfortable are faculty and graduate teaching assistants teaching
  controversial/dificult subjects?
- How can we support faculty and graduate teaching assistants in this?
- Need to assess whether Awaken State finding regarding EMS accurately reflects our students given the very small sample size (seems unlikely given the prominence of climate change in curricula within the college)

John Hellman: this ties directly into EMS strategic plan
